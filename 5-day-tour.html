            <h2>The Itinerary</h2>
            <h3>Day 1: Across the High Atlas</h3>
            <p>Your journey begins with a dramatic ascent from Marrakech into the High Atlas Mountains. You'll traverse the spectacular Tizi n'Tichka pass before descending to the iconic Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou, a fortified village of earthen clay that seems to rise from the land itself. The day concludes in Ouarzazate, a city famed for its film studios.</p>

            <h3>Day 2: Canyons and Valleys</h3>
            <p>Travel the fabled Road of a Thousand Kasbahs, passing through the fragrant Valley of Roses, before arriving at the magnificent Todra Gorges. Here, you'll have the opportunity to walk between the towering canyon walls, a testament to the power of water and time.</p>
            
            <h3>Day 3: Into the Erg Chebbi</h3>
            <p>The landscape grows more profound as you journey towards the Sahara. In the afternoon, you will arrive at the edge of the Erg Chebbi dunes. Here, your camel caravan awaits to carry you across the shifting sands as the sun begins its descent, casting long shadows and bathing the world in a warm, golden light. Your destination is a Berber desert camp, where you'll dine under the stars.</p>

            <h3>Day 4: North Through the Ziz Valley</h3>
            <p>After a desert sunrise, the journey turns north. You'll travel through the vast and verdant Ziz Valley, a ribbon of millions of palm trees that creates a stunning contrast with the surrounding arid landscape. The day ends in Midelt, a quiet town nestled in the Middle Atlas Mountains.</p>
            
            <h3>Day 5: Forests and Arrival in Fes</h3>
            <p>The final leg of your journey takes you through the great cedar forests of Azrou, home to troops of Barbary macaques. After passing through the alpine-style town of Ifrane, you'll arrive in the ancient city of Fes, where this unforgettable passage concludes.</p>

            <blockquote>To travel through the Moroccan south is to witness the raw poetry of the earth. This journey is for those who wish to read it.</blockquote>
