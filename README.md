# Vero Sahara Morocco - Static Blog (Timeless Elegance Theme)

This project is a simple, responsive, and SEO-friendly static blog created using only HTML and CSS. It has been redesigned with a "Timeless Elegance" theme to serve as a premium content and travel guide platform for the main tour website, VeroSaharaMorocco.com.

## Project Purpose

The blog is designed to attract discerning travelers through high-quality, evocative content about journeys in Morocco. It provides inspiration and detailed narratives for potential customers, showcases popular tour itineraries as curated "journeys," and directs users to the main booking website.

## File Structure

The project follows a clean and straightforward multi-page architecture:

-   `index.html`: The main homepage of the blog.
-   `tours.html`: A "Portfolio of Journeys" page.
-   `about.html`: "Our Philosophy" page detailing the company's values.
-   `contact.html`: "Inquire" page for contact details.
-   `7-day-tour.html`: Article page for the 7-day tour.
-   `5-day-tour.html`: Article page for the 5-day tour.
-   `13-day-tour.html`: Article page for the 13-day tour.
-   `styles.css`: A single stylesheet containing all the styles for the entire website.

## Design & Technical Details

-   **Theme:** Timeless Elegance
-   **Typography:** 'Merriweather' for headings (serif) and 'Open Sans' for body text (sans-serif) for a classic, readable feel.
-   **Color Palette:** A warm, sophisticated palette inspired by desert landscapes (Papyrus White, Slate Gray, Terracotta, and Deep Navy).
-   **Layout:** A minimalist, mobile-first design using centered content and generous whitespace to create a premium, uncluttered reading experience. Built with modern CSS practices.
-   **Frameworks/JavaScript:** None. The project is built with pure HTML5 and CSS3 and is fully functional without any client-side scripting.
-   **SEO:** Each page includes unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tags. The content is structured with semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) to improve search engine visibility.

## How to Use

Simply open any of the `.html` files in a web browser to view the website. No build process or server is required for local viewing. To deploy, upload all files to any static web hosting service.
